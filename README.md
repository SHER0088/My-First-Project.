# Implementation of PCA with ANN algorithm for Face recognition.
The project uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to recognize faces, as well as OpenCV and NumPy for face detection.  OpenCV recognizes faces in images, PCA reduces dimensionality by identifying essential features, and ANN classifies faces using these characteristics.  This method enhances both accuracy and efficiency in facial recognition.
